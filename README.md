# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains my practice implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms written in Python as part of my self-learning.

## Algorithms implemented
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Descent
- K-Means Clustering
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to understand the internal working and logic of core ML algorithms rather than relying on high-level libraries.

## Background
Chemical Engineering student with interest in Machine Learning and applied AI.
